Welcome to my personal portfolio website. I am a 3nd-year Computer Science undergraduate from Sri Lanka, passionate about **Distributed Systems**, **Rust**, and **Quantum Computing**. This site showcases my projects, technical articles, and open-source contributions.

## 🚀 About The Project

This portfolio is built for speed and simplicity. Unlike standard templates that lock content into complex TypeScript arrays, this version has been **refactored to be 100% Markdown-driven**.

### Key Features

- **Pure Markdown Content:** Adding a new project is as simple as dropping a `.md` file into a folder.
- **High Performance:** Built with **Astro**, meaning zero JavaScript is sent to the client by default.
- **Type Safety:** Uses Astro Content Collections to ensure all project metadata (dates, tags, images) is correct during the build.
- **Clean Design:** A terminal-inspired, minimalist aesthetic focusing on readability.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Content:** Markdown / MDX
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages
